				<div class="blog-subtitle">Personal information</div>
				<p>I am the third member. My name is Nguyen Huu Thanh Binh. My students ID and email are s3836542 and S3836542@rmit.edu.vn. My major is Digital Marketing, and my general elective is Introduction to Information Systems. I have learned in the fifth semester at RMIT. I chose this course because I want to expand my understanding of IT in the context of the Industry 4.0 transformation. As a result, I can adjust to market trends and grow my business in the future. Watching anime and reading comic books, particularly manga, are two of my favorite pastimes. Football is my favorite sport, and it is also the activity in which I excel. I used to play football for the local club when I was 12 years old, but my family disagreed with me spending so much time doing so. Therefore, I just play football for fun now.
				</p><br/>
				<div class="blog-subtitle">Career plan</div>
				<p>My goal in the future is to become a freelancer in the digital Marketing industry. Because the majority of marketing firms in Vietnam now are traditional, I believe this is an opportunity for me to advance my career in the digital field. According to datareportal (2021), In Vietnam, there are more than 60 million internet users and more than 72 million social media users. This is a potential market for businesses to gain new customers, the digital marketing industry will increase demand in the future. To achieve this goal, I set a short strategy for myself. In semester 6, I will have an internship, and I will try to apply to a marketing firm to gain experience and learn how to build a solid campaign. I also spend 1 or 2 hours per day learning Photoshop online because I discovered that certain companies have criteria for Photoshop skills. In the next step, I will  learn how to run social media ads and SEO by enrolling in the Unica course, which received positive feedback from my friend.. Furthermore, I will attend workshops held by several specialists in this marketing field to gain insight into their experiences and recommendations to contribute my personal.
