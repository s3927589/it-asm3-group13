				<div class="blog-subtitle">Personal Information</div>
				<p>I am the first member of the team. My full name is Nguyen Minh Anh. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number and email are S3927589 and s3927589@rmit.edu.vn, respectively. Before attending RMIT, I spent three years studying Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Because of the covid pandemic, I decided to move back to Vietnam and continue my study at RMIT. My specialization is developing Artificial Intelligence models and researching new techniques. In my spare time, I usually play basketball and practice doing magic tricks. When playing basketball, I normally hold the Point Guard position, so I am really into dribbling. As for magic tricks, I am a magic creator as well as performer and normally work with coins and playing cards.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Career Plan</div>
				<p>My long-term career goal is to become an Artificial Intelligence Expert. I want to create and develop AI technology which is the future of the modern era. Artificial Intelligence allows us to achieve tasks that we thought were impossible to do. For instance, with the help of AI, people can interact with machines via human speech or even hand gestures, which we had never dreamed of 30 years ago. I am a curious person who loves to discover new things, especially ones that are out of imagination. In the short run, I first aim at finding an opportunity to work for a company as an AI Engineer. Once I have some hands-on experience in the field, I will try to get into big brand companies in AI such as VINAI. Huawei, or DeepMind. To achieve my goal, I need to enhance my AI knowledge. Besides AI courses at university, I also completed one online AI Intro course on Coursera and one offline AI Specialist course at VTC Academy. My next step is to research more about AI via reading papers to enrich my understanding and try to implement all common deep learning architectures to improve my coding and model training skills.</p><br/>
