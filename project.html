			<div class="blog-title">OUR PROJECT - Free Asian Stock Images (ASI)</div>

			<div class="blog-content">
				<img class="blog-img" src="./images/ourproject.png" alt="blog img" /><br/><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Overview</div>
				<p>ASI (Asian Stock Images) is a website that offers free stock images of Asian themes in high resolution. All of the images on the site are free to use, edit, copy, and distribute for both noncommercial and commercial reasons. All photographs are licensed under a Creative Commons Zero license, so you don't need to obtain permission or credit the source or ASI. ASI is a place where anyone can join in order to form a creative community that contributes to the common growth of Asia as a whole. Downloading photos from ASI does not necessitate a login. We do not require contributors to have a relationship with someone, to have achievements, or to be represented by an agency in order to publish images. <span class="bold">Anyone is welcome to post their photos, and our approval department will check to see if the photo is appropriate or not and categorize it into the appropriate topic.</span></p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Motivation</div>
				<p>The idea came to me when one of our teammates had trouble locating suitable photographs for her projects due to concerns about copyright and image attributes. ASI is a free alternative to several websites that charge a fee for images for individuals who cannot afford to buy them. This collection of amateur free photographs seems to be ideal for photographers, designers, learners, or anybody seeking for amateur free photos for various projects, memes, templates, or photo ideas. Also, when she needed to find photos of rare subjects for her project, it was really hard or even impossible to get the relevant images. Therefore, gathering many topics on the same website will help and save a lot of time.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Description</div>
				<div class="blog-subtitle-2">a. Features</div>
				<p>ASI is a website that provides FREE high-quality Asia stock photographs.<br/>
					All photographs on ASI are the work of all contributors and our team, and our primary purpose is to broaden the options of photographs. All of the images were recently taken in Vietnam, and we are eagerly awaiting your contribution. Images will be updated at least 60 pictures everyday. We will build a self-learning AI system that will help us make basic classifications of what topics an image belongs to and whether it has sensitive content. Users can select images from categories (eg: fashion, food, health &#38; wellness, sport, street photography, family, student, kid, novice,...), search by keywords or click on suggestions (trending images, recently posted,...)<br/>
					Even though the present material does not display photographs from all Asian nations, we are still doing our best to make it happen in helping broaden the industry's existing creative works. We really hope it is useful to you on your artistic journey.<br/>
					Only high-quality images and creative Asian people photos are eligible for being uploaded to the website.

				<div class="blog-subtitle-2">b. Requirements and Registration</div>
				<p>Users may not be required to log in to download photographs. Nevertheless, there may be a time limit and a limit on the amount of images that can be downloaded. Users who have completed membership registration will have their time offering and the quantity threshold of photographs will be boosted.<br/>
					When users choose to register, they guarantee to provide accurate and up-to-date information as requested by the Service's application form. Our Privacy Policy governs registration data as well as certain other personal information about them. If users are under the age of 16, they may use the Service only with the permission of their family, guardian, or instructor.<br/>
					When registering an account users may need to provide some information such as name, birth, Paypal account (not required), etc. Password is required to make sure the account is secure and confidential. If the users want to donate image authors, Paypal or other payment methods are the only way (if the author provides a PayPal account). In addition, we will have special gratitude for members or those who have made long-term contributions to the website.<br/><br/>
					To build a complete website like ASI, these are the tools that we need:
				</p>
				<div class="blog-grey-container">
					<span class="bold">Web builder:</span> WordPress with starting templates from the Astra plugin.<br/>
					Database: phpMyAdmin, MySQL for managing users’ accounts and image links, and Caspio for creating the registration system.<br/>
					<span class="bold">Image storage:</span> Cloudinary for creating image CDN’s.<br/>
					<span class="bold">Domain and hosting:</span> InfinityFree for free hosting and domain names.<br/>
					<span class="bold">Code editing:</span> FileZilla (as an FTP) and Visual Studio Code (as a code editor).<br/>
					<span class="bold">Testing devices:</span> PC or laptop with common browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and tablet, mobile devices for testing the web responsiveness.<br/>
				</div><br/><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Skills Required</div>
				<ul class="blog-ul">
					<li>Knowing how to use WordPress is a must to build the website.</li>
					<li>Understanding of how frontend (the website interface) and backend (the server) communicate with each other.</li>
					<li>Database management skills to ensure the website logic works properly and monitor the image uploading process. </li>
					<li>Adequate UI/UX design to create an eye-catching and user-friendly interface as well as handle the responsiveness problem.</li>
					<li>Content creating skills to write appealing website content for the Home, Gallery, About, and Blog pages.</li>
					<li>Group work: requires teamwork abilities in harmony across several web positions, including photographer, software engineer, content creator, and designer.</li>
				</ul><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Outcome</div>
				<p>High-quality photographs in advertisements, projects, or websites can significantly improve credibility and user experience. They not only attract people's attention, but they also bring substantial advantages in terms of visual viewing. We aim that ASI will serve as a venue for creators to connect, inspire, and express their creativity with their audiences and other photographers, as well as a platform for addressing the demand for Asian imagery.</p><br/><br/>
