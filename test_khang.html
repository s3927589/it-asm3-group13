				<p>When I finished the Myers-Briggs test, the website suggested characters with similar personalities to me as a Debater such as The Joker, Captain Jack Sparrow, Thomas Edison. They are characters with very unique and cool living ideals. Incidentally, they are all characters from history and movies that I love and admire very much. I agree with what the analysis says about me. In addition to the basic personality, I always want to show my reasoning ability to defend an idea that I consider to be true. Thanks to these tests, I know myself better. It helps me express things inside of me that I didn't know what to call, even though I was aware of them. exist inside of me.</p>

				<p>I am a person who loves challenges and asking questions. Therefore, when working in groups, I will not hesitate to ask questions to stimulate the imagination and creativity of everyone in the group. I'm an open-minded person, and I believe that makes it easier and comfortable for everyone to work with each other. In addition, through these tests, I now realize that my arguments now tend to be that I want to be the winner. The test analyzes that I should not be like that, but consider arguing is a way to understand people better and build consensus and relationships.</p>

				<p>Once I've secured such a position, in my mind, I always know that I need to remember for my ideas to come to fruition, I will always depend on others to assemble the pieces. First I will find like-minded people to form a team. It would be great if I could work with people with similar personalities, but the differences can also be pieces of the puzzle that make the picture more complete. I think in my team I need someone with a calm head to cool me down when needed. Examples are the times when I am excited, over-excited or overly ambitious, delusional about something. Since very argumentative and Dislike Practical Matters are my weaknesses.</p><br/>
