				<div class="blog-subtitle">Personal information</div>
				<p>As the second member of the team, my name is Pham Thi Thuy Duong who has a background in Digital Marketing. My student identification number and email address are s3836551 and s3836551@rmit.edu.vn , respectively. Probably the best way to characterize me is as well organized, energetic, and open. I first became aware of K-Pop during my senior year of high school; since then, I've had a strong conviction in K-Pop stars, which has had a huge good effect on my personality and interests. They are a huge source of inspiration for me in the fields of Media, Photoshop, and Technology, which are all areas of my passion that I am constantly researching and learning about. Besides, I enjoy skateboarding and watching movies, particularly K-Dramas, in my spare time. Korean dramas have done an amazing job of providing a fulfilling experience of filmmaking, from camera angle to content to soundtrack, enticing me to do something to improve the Vietnamese film industry in the near future.

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Career plan</div>
				<p>Currently, I'm seeking for an appropriate organization to begin my internship, with the goal of gaining experience and weaning myself off of academic subjects and grades. To be honest, I feel that only about 4-5 of the subjects I am studying at RMIT are truly applicable to the career I am pursuing, so I do have a lot of plans after graduation. On the one hand, I want to work as a digital marketer for fashion or food stores, where I'll be responsible for creativity, photography, campaign ideas, and everything else linked to media. On the other hand, I want to study or work in Korea because it has been a dream of mine since I was in high school to study overseas. My personality test answers are practically accurate, even though I enjoy stability (job, life), I am not content to stay in my comfort zone indefinitely.
