                   <p> As the fourth member of the group, my name is Khang Minh Nguyen. My RMIT ID: s3931505. My email address: s3931505@rmit.edu.vn. I am an emotional person. Although I am interested in math, chess and things related to reasoning, I suppose that most of my decisions are more emotional. I was born in Long An province, and my childhood revolved around Japanese anime such as Conan, Doraemon. The adventures in the stories made me extremely amazed and curious about the world around me so I love to travel and learn about the culture of the places I visit. Because of that enthusiasm for discovery, I decided to study abroad in the US at a high school in California. There, I met friends from many different countries. They are very friendly and nice to me. I am most impressed by the people from Korea because they are very smart and handsome. One of them visited Vietnam and I became his guide. After graduating from high school, I applied to a university in the city of Seattle in Washington state to major in computer science. However, the Covid 19 epidemic suddenly came and disrupted my life and made me decide to return to Vietnam and study at RMIT University in Information Technology. I believe that God has a special mission for each of us and that God is always with me on my way.

               			<div class="blog-subtitle">Career Plan</div>
				<p>After graduating from college, I want to be a programmer. Specifically, I want to program apps and games. My dream is to work for the world-famous American game company Riot because I like League of Legends very much. Along the way, I will learn more C++, Python, HTML, Java, and C# as well as programming languages ​​that can help me create useful apps or interesting games. I plan to study for a master's degree so that I have more opportunities to work for foreign companies or even work abroad. After 10 years of working in the IT segment, I think I will start to move into the financial and securities investment segment. Because at this point I believe I have also accumulated a decent amount of money for myself. At the moment, I think I do not want to start up; however, I also don't want to be just a hired worker. I want to get rich and I think it is the right time to step into another field because I will have had more experience and connections. I think I will retire and leave the IT industry after earning 5 million dollars.

                </p><br/>
