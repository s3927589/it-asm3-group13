			<div class="blog-title"> Testing</div>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Documentation testing</div>
				<p>Tester will test the documents on the web page (web page functionality, test the layout of the website and plan the site test for further testing.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Functional testing</div>
				<p>External links: We will correct internal linking, make sure there are no links to the same page, check if there are pages that are not referenced and no broken link.</p><br/>
				<p>Cookies’ test: We will check website with cookies disabled and enabled; verify that the cookie is encrypted before being written to the user's machine; Iif the cookie has an active time, it is checked to see if they were active for the specified time period.</p><br/>
				<p>HTML/CSS Validation: HTML syntax error; Verify site availability for search engines; Verify that the site has a correct sitemap in both XML and HTML formats</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Usability Testing</div>
				<p>The navigation test includes the following verifications: all the pages on our website are easy to understand and use; Buttons, shapes and fields are convenient to use; Get access to the Main menu from all pages.</p><br/>
				<p>Content Testing including no grammar and spelling errors; the image is properly placed to the right size; verify optimization of website color scheme and font size; content should be informative, easy to understand, structured and logically linked; instructions are clear and contain correct information.</p><br/>


				<div class="blog-subtitle">UI Testing</div>
				<p>We’ll need to evaluate design elements: layout, colors, fonts, font size, labels, text boxes, text formatting, captions, buttons, lists, icons, links; experiment with different screen resolutions; check localized versions: accuracy of translation (multi-language, multi-currency), check name length of interface elements, etc.; test the graphical user interface on target devices: smartphones and tablets.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Compatibility (Configuration) testing</div>
				<p>Different database configurations: Oracle, DB2, MySql, MSSQL Server, Sybase could be use to  to ensure correct operation of our website, as cross-platform testing allows users to evaluate the performance of the website in different operating systems (both desktop and mobile): Windows, iOS/Mac OS, Linux, Android and BlackBerry, etc. Moreover, cross-browser website testing methods help verify correct website operation in different browser configurations: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Opera, etc.</p><br/>
				
				<div class="blog-subtitle">Beta testing</div>
				<p>Conducted by end users and people. Beta test replacing the site in the hands of real users outside of our team to uncover any weaknesses from the user's point of view that we don't want in the final version of the released app.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Mobile-friendly testing</div>
				<p>We will need to verify compatibility with smartphones and tablets; make sure website navigation is as simple as possible; optimize our website load time; make sure the buttons are big enough for people with big fingers; optimize all image size; verify websites can access our location via GPS.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Change related testing</div>
				<p>Change related testing has two main purposes: Make sure all detected bugs have actually been successfully fixed (Recheck or Verify). In short, we will re-run the test cases that detected the original error and this time they will pass without any problems; make sure new defects have not appeared after the changes (Regression testing). Besides the detected error test cases, it also contains test cases that test all the functionality of our website.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Security testing</div>
				<p>We also need to make sure no unauthorized access to secure sites is possible; verification sessions are automatically broken after a long period of user inactivity; Check SSL Security Functions; all break attempts, bug reports, etc. must be recorded and stored in a separate file for further analysis; make sure restricted files can't be downloaded without proper permissions; make sure there is no possibility of login when the wrong password or username is entered.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Performance testing.</div>
				<li>Test website behavior at or beyond its expected workload limit (Stress testing).</li>
				<li>Test website behavior as the workload increases (Load testing).</li>
				<li>Testing the ability to work within or just above the acceptable time period (Stability testing.</li>
				<li>Test website performance by increasing the volume of data in the database (Volume testing).</li>
				<li>Test website performance when multiple users are logged in to it at the same time (Concurrency testing).</li>
				<li>Test site behavior when additional workloads are continuously provisioned (Endurance testing).</li>
				<li>Check page loading speed.</li>
