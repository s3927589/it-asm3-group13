				<div class="blog-subtitle">Overview</div>
				<p>ASI (Asian Stock Images) is a website that offers free stock images of Asian themes in high resolution. All of the images on the site are free to use, edit, copy, and distribute for both noncommercial and commercial reasons. All photographs are licensed under a Creative Commons Zero license, so you don't need to obtain permission or credit the source or ASI. ASI is a place where anyone can join in order to form a creative community that contributes to the common growth of Asia as a whole. Downloading photos from ASI does not necessitate a login. We do not require contributors to have a relationship with someone, to have achievements, or to be represented by an agency in order to publish images. <span class="bold">Anyone is welcome to post their photos, and our approval department will check to see if the photo is appropriate or not and categorize it into the appropriate topic.</span></p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Aim
				</div>
				<p>The purpose of creating this website is to provide people a place to download and upload diverse and reputable images. We want the photos on the website to be carefully selected to ensure the content is good, unique, amazing. We also encourage those who have a passion for photography to post their photos, and have the opportunity to become contributors to the site. In addition to business purposes, we want this to be a place where people can connect with the site's contributors (usually selected photographers) in addition to donating to support the photographers; and customers can hire them to take photos on demand. 
					<br/><br/>
					Besides, creating this website we aim to be different in terms of technology so that we can optimize the new and unique features of the website. We want to create a smart AI recognition system that can recognize the contextual content in the pictures and can scan for pictures taken in the same places. We also want to make taking and posting pictures simple and quick for the site's contributors. We want to bring a chip that integrates with the camera that when taking a picture, the picture will be automatically saved into the system on the website. Along with those improvements, we want to bring users a truly professional experience.
					</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Plans and Progress : </div>
				<div class="blog-subtitle-2">a. Idea of ASI</div>
				<p>Duong, a member of our team, came up with the concept of the Asian stock image (ASI) project when she was working on Assignment 3 of her marketing communication course. She wanted to find a nice picture to use in her project. However, she was experiencing issues with copyright and image quality because the image on Google is not a good quality and trusted resource. Furthermore, she is also a member of the Marketing for Young People group on Facebook, which is made up of people who work in the marketing sector. She shared her dilemma with this group and received several responses from people who were experiencing the same problems. Therefore, she discusses this issue with our team and wants to initiate the ASI project and consider it as a solution for marketing professionals. 


				<div class="blog-subtitle-2">b. Overview and process of ASI project:      
				</div>
				<p>ASI is a website that offers high-resolution Asia stock photos for free. All of the images on ASI are the result of the efforts of all contributors and our crew, and our primary goal is to expand the photographic alternatives available. For the first time, We will hire photographers and ask them to shoot pictures of various topics such as the environment, people, architecture, and more to get a high-quality and beautiful image. Furthermore, we also contribute some functions which will encourage people to share their pictures. For instance, create the top list for contributors who have the most contribution for ASI, and a gift for the top 3 people. It also includes a donation feature, allowing others to donate to the author of the image they are interested in. It also serves as an incentive for contributors to post their photos on this website. Besides, users can only download five free photographs each day. If they want to download more, they must create and log in to their account. We have implemented an AI function that will learn about the customer's habits and suggest a theme picture. Therefore, they can save time by locating images that correspond to their anticipated topic. Furthermore, because the name and contact information of authors will be displayed below the image, the user can contact contributors if they wish to employ them to take a picture.

				

				<div class="blog-subtitle">c. How it began, how it has progressed:				</div>
				<ul class="blog-ul">
					We initially believed the plan would not be chosen due to its lack of 'specialness.' However, in terms of feasibility and plausibility of developing an actual product in a short amount of time, this is probably not a bad choice. We had our first meeting, during which I explained the site's rationale, function, and purpose, as well as the value it provided to the user. Likewise to how we built a website profile, I first looked for similar photo or media sharing sites and then used Wix to design a website. Even though this process is time consuming, it is not tough, Wix continues to baffle me. In comparison to Canva, Wix is rather sluggish, I'm unfamiliar with how to use it, and waiting for commands to execute is frequently a lengthy process. Additionally, to complete the website's appearance, I sought for additional photos from existing websites that offered similar functionality to our product. The process of putting the notion into action went fairly easily, just in the sequence in which it should have occurred. At this level, we will not code a website but rather build it using Wix. However, we do intend to make a brief clip as an advertisement to provide an exciting introduction to the website.
				</ul><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">d. Challenges: </div>
				<p>The difficulty in the process of making this project has two main parts: the technology part and the management part. In terms of technology, in order to find and develop special features of the website, we need to study and research similar websites. We feel that developing AI software for image recognition and classification will be difficult and time consuming as it will take time for AI to learn and recognize many types of images with different subject types as well as scan to see if the images posted by users have appeared somewhere or not. It would be easy if the content was in the form of text, but this is an image so it will be more challenging. As for the management, we find it very rare to find collaborators around the globe willing to work on a new website for a low fee. So we are discussing whether to turn the site into a social media site for photographers and give them benefits in exchange for allowing us to use their images for the third party. 
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="bold">Information needed for taking over the project</span>
					<br/><br/>
					When taking over the project, it is crucial to know almost all information regarding the project. First, understanding the project objective is a must (refer to the overview section). Once the goal of the project is clear, it would be easy for developers to understand later requirements. Then, the functional and non-functional requirements of the project should be analyzed to have a more detailed comprehension of what should be done in the project. Our team will also provide all necessary charts for the other team. All the structural and behavioral diagrams such as flow charts, class diagrams, component diagrams will be provided for the developers to understand the high-level architecture of the system. A Gantt chart is also an important one to keep track of which tasks were completed and which were not. Another vital factor needed to pay attention to is the budget of the project. Since there are very few people in our team, the budget for the project would not be so generous. Therefore, the developers should use as few third-party APIs as possible to lower the cost. Before starting working on the project, our team will hold a meeting session with the other team to explain all the necessary information regarding the project.
