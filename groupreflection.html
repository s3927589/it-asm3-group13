				<div class="blog-subtitle">Minh Anh’s Reflection</div>
				<p>Working on the project with the team was a great experience for me. Although our team did not have enough time to complete the whole system, we managed to finish the planning stage and provide a demo for the website. The most surprising thing during working on the project was the ability to quickly learn new things of the team members. At first, I was really afraid of building the website as the team had no experience in the field. However, all the members were able to adopt the new tool - Wix very quickly. Thus, the frontend of the website was almost completed. Nevertheless, the backend of the website was left untouched. I think the team should try to manage the time more efficiently so that we can have time to develop and improve the backend. As for the portfolio website, since we were familiar with Git from assignment 2, all team members felt more confident when using it, which made the integration and sharing process easier. Therefore, I found it really comfortable and convenient to use Git for better teamwork. Moreover, with the Git log feature, I was able to observe how other members worked, so I could recognize if anyone had any problems and assign appropriate tasks to each member.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Minh Khang’s Reflection</div>
				<p>Working with the team, I find myself learning many things from my teammates. They make me feel comfortable and fun to work with. I am very grateful to the captain of the team (Mr. Anh) for guiding the team as well as making all the plans for the team. He is a considerate person, cares about the members, helped us when we had difficulties in the project. Next, I would like to thank the other two members, Ms. Duong and Mr. Binh. They contributed ideas, together making beautiful presentations. In addition, they also shared to comfort me when I faced trouble in my personal life. They supported, advised, and encouraged me during the project. In general, in terms of expertise and diligence, everyone shows themselves to be responsible and good in certain fields. The captain is good at information technology, Binh and Duong are good at finding and developing ideas. If given the opportunity to work with the team again, I would still be very happy. I believe that each member of the team has the element to become an excellent individual in a team when working at the company. At the end of this course, I won't see them again at school, but they have become part of my fondest memories at RMIT.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Binh’s reflection</div>
				<p>I enjoy working on this project with my team because we all have good abilities and responsibilities. In this project, we have some trouble managing our time because each of us has multiple deadlines to meet. However, we have adequate meetings to analyze the project and determine the objectives for this project because all of the team members have good time management skills. Duong is the primary designer for the website prototype, and I only help her in designing a small perspective. In my opinion, I think I have less contribution than other members, and it makes me feel disappointed in myself. Therefore, I will try to assist other team members by summarizing the project, reviewing the workflow, or asking if they want me to assist them. Furthermore, although I learned Git as part of the course, I still lack expertise in this area. However, it is fortunate for me that Minh Anh introduced and explained Git to me in greater detail, allowing me to understand more and complete my portion. The inventiveness and self-learning of my team members have surprised me the most. When we analyze the project, they frequently come up with good ideas and point out the positive elements. Furthermore, they usually research and find out the outside source to improve the quality of the project. In my opinion, Git is a useful tool for allowing all team members to collaborate on a project. Furthermore, we can keep track of each other and monitor how the project is progressing.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Duong’s Reflection</div>
				<p>Throughout the course, I felt as though it was my destiny to work with the members. As usual, I worked quite hard on the essay, as did the other members. Team meetings, whether online or offline, are incredibly effective. Due to each member's confidence and the easygoing collaborative culture, I came up with numerous ideas, which was made even more spectacular by the members' responses. For instance, creating a short website trailer featuring Minh Anh's wink. Besides,  It's a shame we can't come up with more unique ideas, considering the members all have excellent project ideas. One thing I've taken away from this class is the value of collaboration and selecting a teammate. I honestly can't imagine without being a member of the existing group. Perhaps I would not be so comfortable and joyful, I wouldn't look forward to attending this class every Friday. With regards to Git, in my opinion, Git does not adequately reflect all of the contributions made by each participant to the work. Because Minh Anh is nearly entirely responsible for creating the code and frequently uses Git, while other people, such as myself, design the website interface and conduct related research. Git truly reflects the amount of effort accomplished by the critical individuals involved in the programming process.</p><br/>

					Overall, working together is a great time for everyone on the team. We meet the deadline on time, take responsibility for our contributions, and work together to improve the project's quality. Anh and Khang have good IT talents such as coding, AI, and more, whereas Binh and Duong can design, be creative, and make a nice PowerPoint presentation. Therefore, we can effortlessly assign the job to all of our team members. Khang and Anh have a lot of duties and spend lots of time providing HTML to our website. Duong and Binh's primary responsibilities include website design and PowerPoint creation.<br/><br/>

					To evaluate each member in groups, Minh Anh is the captain in charge of our team's work on this project. He went out of his way to show and explain how to use Git in our project. Therefore, Although other members are new to Git, Anh's effort aids us in completing this project successfully and swiftly. For Khang, he is a member who contributes several solid ideas and picks up new information rapidly. To explain, he initially did not know HTML, but after Anh introduced him. Khang picked it up quickly and became Minh Anh's main assistant in creating the website. From Duong's perspective, She has a great ability to design a website, and PowerPoint, including providing numerous ideas for building the interface and function of websites. Moreover, she is a dynamic and entertaining person who makes our sessions more active, comfortable, and intimate, making it easier to chat and exchange ideas. In the Binh aspects, he is also creative and provides some good ideas during the meetings. Moreover, his responsibility is to work with the report. For example, summarising some parts or comparing the career plan of all members of the team. Moreover, he also assisted Duong in finishing the website and PowerPoint designs.<br/><br/>

Although there are several positive aspects to working on the project, our group experiences some hurdles. It takes longer to introduce Git to Duong and Binh because they have no prior IT experience. Furthermore, we didn't have time to collaborate and finish the project swiftly because all of the members had multiple assignments due during the last semester. Thankfully, because all team members have good responsibilities and skills, the project is completed on schedule, and we have time to review everything.<br/><br/>
